# v21 iteration log (append-only)

Each row = one coder cycle. Newest at top. The Opus 4.8 loop reads this before acting so it
builds on prior attempts instead of repeating them. Format:
`[UTC] item# — what changed — how verified — expected next-run effect`.

- [2026-07-06] **item #1 (P0)** — config-aware evolve evaluator. Added
  `evolve.config_aware_eval_fn(corpus_rhae, walls_by_game, probe_fn)`: score = corpus
  floor + (1-floor)·mean(wall RHAE under the challenger's config), so a challenger that
  cracks a budget-gated wall scores strictly higher and can PROMOTE. Wired into
  `cadence_runner` with `_make_evolve_probe` (applies `blitz_K`→BFS `max_states` on the
  real engine); probe is opt-in via env `V21_EVOLVE_PROBE=1` (live rollout multiplies
  cadence wall-clock) and safely degrades to the corpus floor when off. Verified:
  py_compile + `test_offline.py` green with 4 new checks (floor fallback, config-
  sensitivity, floor-monotonicity, end-to-end generalization-gated promotion); tests now
  write history to a temp file so they don't pollute `evolution_history.jsonl`. Champion
  untouched (still v0). Expected next run: same behavior by default; set
  `V21_EVOLVE_PROBE=1` (with adequate `--bfs-timeout` budget) to let evolve actually
  promote a wall-cracking challenger.

- [2026-07-06] **bugfix** — added `solver.load()` + `solver.solutions[lvl]` chaining in
  `cadence_runner.solve_game`; fixed Ollama 404 (model-presence check + clear error).
  Verified: py_compile + inspected `combined_agent.BFSSolver` API. Effect: real BFS now runs
  on the Mac (was failing instantly with NoneType). — champion still v0.
- [2026-07-06] **scaffold** — built the loop: `runtime_coder` (on-the-fly WM writer, sandbox
  exec, tested), `evolve` (champion/challenger), `intuition` (corpus prior), `llm_backend`
  (ollama/hf/openai/mock). Verified: offline end-to-end test (ft09/ls20-like solves via mock).
- [2026-07-06] **seed** — corpus seeded from v20 (ls20 L0–L4, ft09 L0–L1, vc33 L0–L3); official
  baselines wired; RHAE floor measured (ls20 0.966, ft09 1.0, vc33 1.0; 9 wall levels).

## Next up (from BACKLOG P0): item #2 — live blitz Stage-0 in `MyAgent`. (Item #1
## evaluator is coded + offline-verified; enabling its live probe on the Mac
## `V21_EVOLVE_PROBE=1` is the remaining Mac-side step to trigger a real promotion.)
